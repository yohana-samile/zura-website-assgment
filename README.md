TASK:
Pick an organisation (real or fictitious) of your choice, and develop for it a database-driven website having the 
following features:
i. Has a very appealing interface
ii. Enables the site visitors to provide feedback, comments, or ask questions to the organisation. These 
should be saved in the database, along with the record of the actual time that they were submitted.
iii. Enables the site visitors to request an appointment with the organisation officials. To do this, they should 
be able to view (and select) the available day and time slots. This should be dynamically populated from 
the database.
iv. Enables the system administrators to view the feedback/comments/questions submitted. If you can 
enable them to respond it will be a PLUS.
v. Enable the system administrators to view all the appointments for any given day. If you can enable them 
to print all the appointments of any given day in a PDF document it will be a PLUS.
